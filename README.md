My name is Eliyahu and I'm backend developer.

Here I mostly put my miscellaneous projects.

For example You can look at my recent [project](https://github.com/eliduvid/GeneticDots) about genetic algorithm, or an [old one](https://github.com/eliduvid/BattleCalc) with online interpreter for assembly-like language.
